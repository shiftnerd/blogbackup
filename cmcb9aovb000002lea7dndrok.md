I had the chance to attend MSPGeekCon this year, and I’m incredibly grateful to the team for giving me that opportunity. What I expected to be a fairly quiet booth presence turned into something much more productive and energizing. Here’s a recap of the highlights, takeaways, and a few fun moments along the way.

### Crushing the Demo Goal

We went into the event with the idea that most attendees would already be Rewst customers or at least familiar with us. That turned out to be only partially true. Perhaps in part due to Eddie’s talk and Zentop's pre-day event, we had a great influx of interest from folks who hadn’t used Rewst yet or hadn’t even heard of us before.

### Quick Wins and Real-Time Problem Solving

One standout moment was hearing people talk about how Schema Doctor helped them at their job. While there, I even showed new users the tool and empowered them to integrate their CRM, which opened up more automation possibilities for them and their clients. That kind of hands-on help is one of my favorite parts of being at these events.

I also spent time with an existing partner. I destroyed them at Exploding Kittens on game night — although they got the last laugh during a chaotic round of Incoherent.

### Community Conversations and Feedback

A big chunk of my time was spent talking with other power users about their friction points in the platform. Many provided feedback about small features that could make a big difference in usability.

I also had some great conversations with n8n users curious about Rewst. I think there’s room for more than one automation tool in a stack and Rewst has some clear advantages for MSPs.

### Internal Collaboration and Churn Reduction Ideas

The event wasn’t just outward-facing. I had some valuable conversations with Rewst members about ways to improve the client experience.

### Sessions and Takeaways

Eddie’s session was solid, and I was especially impressed by the panel with Jason Slagle, Matt Lee, and Dustin Bolander. It gave me a fresh perspective on how to evolve solutions I had made in the past. I also caught a neurodiversity panel that stuck with me. One thing I plan to explore further is [manualof.me](http://manualof.me)[, a site th](https://www.manualof.me)at helps indi[viduals exp](https://www.manualof.me)lain how they work best. It’s something I might personally use and recommend to other team members.

It was a packed couple of days, and I came back with a lot of insights, a few new ideas, and some great conversations still rattling around in my head. I’ve always enjoyed hearing what others bring back from conferences, so I hope this recap offers some of that same value.

MSPGeekCon will be uploading their sessions and panels on their youtube channel.
