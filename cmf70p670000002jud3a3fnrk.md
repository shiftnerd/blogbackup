In 2011, when I was still a student at Independence High School, I experienced one of my first major moments in technology. I won the Tennessee SkillsUSA state competition in computer networking and earned a place at the national conference in Kansas City.

The *Williamson Herald* covered the story at the time, and it remains one of my favorite throwbacks(Though they don‚Äôt show the picture on the website): [Read the original article here](https://www.williamsonherald.com/features/education/indy-s-ben-climer-advances-to-skillsusa-national-leadership-and-skills-conference/article_30f18568-d913-55d4-b05d-0192d5af607c.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

That year I competed against some of the best high school students in the state. The contest required skills in computer and network configuration, troubleshooting, and IT problem-solving under pressure. Weirdly one of the challenges I think that helped me was a mapped drive challenge. Waiting for the state results was one of the most intense moments of my life, and I was thrilled when my name was announced as the winner.

What stands out even more is the support that surrounded me. My CTE(Career and Technical Education) teacher, Keith Steffens, guided me and pushed me to refine my technical abilities. Community leaders and local businesses also stepped up to help fund my trip, showing how strongly Williamson County values technology education and workforce development.

For me, this event was not just about winning a medal or earning recognition. It became a launching point. At 17 I was already working on web design projects and consulting for clients, but SkillsUSA gave me a clear view of what a future career in IT might look like. It proved that the hours I had invested in tinkering with systems and solving technical challenges were building something real.

Looking back, I can see how this competition influenced the path I would take in my career. It encouraged me to pursue opportunities in managed services, automation, and building tools for the MSP community. It also showed me the value of mentorship and community support, which are still themes in my work today.

If you would like to revisit that moment, here is the original coverage from 2011:
