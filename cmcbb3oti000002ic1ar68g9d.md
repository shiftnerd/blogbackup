As I look back on 2023, it was a year that brought a mix of challenges, recognition, and growth across both personal and professional fronts. I wanted to take a moment to reflect on a few highlights that meant a lot to me, and to acknowledge the communities and people that made them possible.

### Chasing Breadcrumbs at CyberDrain CTF

One of the recurring events I always look forward to is the **CyberDrain CTF**. If you're in the MSP or sysadmin world and haven't checked it out yet, I highly recommend it. You can find it at [ctf.cyberdrain.com](http://ctf.cyberdrain.com). It's a capture-the-flag competition designed specifically for people in our industry, focusing on real-world scenarios that help sharpen both technical and problem-solving skills.

This past year marked the **third time I've placed in the Top 5**, and it's always an adrenaline-fueled experience going toe-to-toe with some of the sharpest minds in the field. The CTF is packed with cleverly hidden breadcrumbs and requires not just technical knowledge, but creativity and persistence. Every time I participate, I walk away having learned something new.

What makes this event special isn't just the challenge itself, but the community around it. I want to give a sincere thank you to **Kelvin Tegelaar**, **Gavin Stone**, **Luke Whitelock**, **John Duprey**, and **Stephen Murphy** for all the time, thought, and effort that goes into creating this experience. A lot of love and late nights go into building something this detailed and this useful. It's events like these that help grow the skillset of the entire community, and I’m always grateful to be a part of it.

### Honored to Be Named a Kentucky Colonel

On a very different but equally meaningful note, I had the unexpected honor of being named a **Kentucky Colonel** by the Governor of Kentucky. For those unfamiliar, this is the highest civilian honor awarded by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and it’s given in recognition of noteworthy accomplishments or service.

The recognition came as a result of my work with the **Information Technology Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC)** during the recovery efforts following the **Eastern Kentucky flooding**. The devastation was severe, and entire communities were left without basic services. Our team assisted in restoring communication infrastructure so that emergency services and residents could get back online, coordinate relief, and start rebuilding.

The work itself is always what matters most. You show up, get your boots muddy, and do what needs to be done. But it was moving to see the efforts of the team recognized in such a formal way. I share that honor with my fellow ITDRC volunteers who put in the long hours and worked through incredibly difficult conditions. If you’re unfamiliar with the ITDRC, I’d encourage you to learn more at [itdrc.org](https://itdrc.org). They do incredible work helping communities in times of crisis, and I’m proud to be part of that mission.

### Bringing the PowerShell Community Back Together

This year also marked the return of something near and dear to me: the **Middle Tennessee PowerShell User Group**. Alongside **Mick Pletcher**, we brought the group back into action and shifted it to a virtual format to make it more accessible to folks inside and outside of the region.

PowerShell has always been one of my favorite tools in the sysadmin and automation toolbox, and user groups like this are a great way to stay sharp, share knowledge, and support one another in solving the tough technical challenges we all face. Whether you're just getting started or have been scripting for years, our sessions are open to all, and we’d love to have you join in. You can find more info and upcoming meeting details [here](https://lnkd.in/eU34mmq9).

### A New Chapter: CTO at SNS

Finally, one of the most significant shifts for me this year has been a change in role. I stepped into the position of **Chief Technology Officer at SNS**. It’s a role that allows me to lean into the areas I’m most passionate about: systems architecture, automation, scalability, and adding real value to both the business and the customers we serve.

Taking on a CTO role isn't something I take lightly. It means stepping up, not just in terms of technical leadership, but also in supporting the team, aligning strategy with execution, and building a culture that encourages experimentation, learning, and excellence. I’m excited about where we’re headed and deeply motivated to help shape a future where our technology is not just functional, but transformative.

Looking back on 2023, the common thread through all these moments has been **community**. Whether it’s competing with peers at CyberDrain, serving disaster-stricken areas with ITDRC, rebooting the PowerShell user group, or stepping into a leadership role at SNS, none of it happens in a vacuum. It happens through collaboration, mentorship, shared challenges, and mutual respect.

If you're someone in tech trying to figure out where to plug in, my advice is simple: get involved. Show up. Whether it’s a user group, a volunteer effort, a hackathon, or just helping a peer solve a tough problem, those experiences will shape your career and your character in ways you can’t always predict. I’m thankful for everyone who’s been part of that journey with me this year.

Here's to what comes next.
