Ben Climer is an IT professional in the Kansas City area.

Hi, I'm Ben Climer. I’ve been taking things apart and figuring out how they work for as long as I can remember. I built my first computer at age eight, mostly out of necessity after breaking the family one. By twelve, I was coding websites with streaming embedded music. As a teenager, I competed in national contests for web design and computer repair, and discovered early on that I enjoyed solving problems that others found frustrating.

After high school, I started working in IT, eventually spending over a decade in the MSP world. I held a mix of technical and leadership roles, often jumping between fixing urgent issues and planning long-term solutions. That experience shaped how I think about automation today. Automation started as something the MSP I was working for didn’t do, scripting, and turned in a career passion.

I now work at Rewst, where I help others build better workflows and automation. I focus on making tools that are reusable, easy to understand, and built to scale. I'm also involved in community training, internal process improvements, and building things like Schema Doctor to make technical work a little smoother for everyone.

Outside of work, I’m into cars, road trips, and co-hosting my podcast, Panda Award Show.  
  
I live in Kansas City, Kansas, and I still find joy in chasing down bugs that make no sense on paper.
